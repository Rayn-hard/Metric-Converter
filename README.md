# Metric-Converter
This is a simple project made for the subject ITCC14 when I was a student.
This project is a showcase to show that we are able to utilize different languages and systems to build an application.

This simple project converts values from and to centimeter, meter, or kilometer.

It uses HTML, PHP, and CSS as a base, MySQL for the database. then JavaScript to fetch data from the database as an API.
